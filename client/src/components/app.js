                                You were supposed to come here with a specific link. Otherwise I don't really know to which poll to send you. 
                                Try talking to whomever sent you this link, or starting over somehow.
                            </Typography>
                            <Typography variant="body1" style={{marginTop:"20px"}}>Good luck!</Typography>
